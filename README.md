# Reinto-to-C-ToDo-List
A todo list created in C++

First I created a simple loop to get the gist of what I intended to do. 
Realizing that this loop did not actually save any data: it only printed whatever you enter to the screen, I created a ToDoList to save objects to it.
In doing so, I realized I needed to overload a few operators to perform some code comparisons to make sure it does what I think it does.

I am soon to create a UI that is hopefully, cross platform, or at least web-based.
